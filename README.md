# Flux (Forge Edition)

**Flux** is a mod which provides energy implementation to Vanilla block (like Furnace) without additional items. It comes with useful machines that make item processing even more interesting.

This is a complete rewrite of [Minecraft-Flux](https://github.com/Szewek/Minecraft-Flux).

# Flux (Version 4.4.1)

### Recipes with tagged items
These recipes can be used for compatibility with other mods.
Some tagged processing recipes are added for silver, lead, uranium and osmium.

**NOTE!** Grit recipes won't appear if another mod doesn't add its own items at `forge:grits` tag.

**ANOTHER NOTE!** Tagged recipes will be disabled after adding `"jaopca"` in `preferModCompat` list in Flux config file.
This setting makes sure that JAOPCA will generate its own recipes so duplicates won't appear.

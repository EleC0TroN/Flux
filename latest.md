# Flux (Version 4.8.0)
Requires Flux Library 3.0.7 - [Download here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fl/files/2885527)

## Now compatible with other recipe types
Few recipe types are compatible with Flux recipes. More will be added later.

This feature may crash the game (due to unsuspected recipe requirements).
If you are a modpack maker, first check if any recipe is causing a crash.
If that happens, add its recipe type (you have to find it yourself) and add to
`blacklistCompatRecipes` list in Flux config (and restart the game).

### Recipe types added
- `pattysmorestuff:crushing`
- `silents_mechanisms:crushing`
- `usefulmachinery:crushing`
- `blue_power:alloy_smelting`
- `silents_mechanisms:alloy_smelting`
- `wtbw_machines:compressing`

Requires Flux Library 3.2.1 - [Download here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fl/files)

### Fixes

- **Farmer** - one seed is properly removed from items gathered from crops. A seed must be registered in `forge:seeds` item tag.

- **Mob Pounder** - now kills every mob, including slimes, magma cubes and ghasts.

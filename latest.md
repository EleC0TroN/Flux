### A new way to create Flux Gifts
You may remember that you could receive Flux Gifts on specific day.
Now gifts can be created by data pack makers.
All players will receive gifts declared in `flux/gifts/global_list.json`.
Each gift can be received once.

You will receive a gift after logging in.

### New items: gears and plates
These are used as a crafting component.
Each metal has its own gear and plate.
Crafting recipes are added.

### Changes in Flux recipes
Almost all crafting recipes were changed to use gears and plates.

### Other changes
- Multifactory (WIP) has a new texture
- Removed `silents_mechanisms:alloy_smelting` from recipe compatibility list

# Flux (Version 4.5.0)

### Bronze
New items and recipes are added for bronze.

### Chips and upgrades
Some machines can now use Flux Chips to change process speed and energy usage.
Upgrades can only be purchased from Villagers (Flux Engineers sell these).

### Disabling ore generation
You can disable generating ores in the world.
You should use this option only if another mod generates tin and copper ores and there is too much of them.
